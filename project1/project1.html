              <p>
                  <b><i>Iceland</i></b> is a country of sharp contrasts. A place where fire and ice co-exist. Where dark winter are offset by the summer's midnight sun. A country where insular existence has spurred a rich and vibrant culture.

                      <p>The Aurora Borelis takes its name from the Roman goddess of Dawn, Aurora and the Greek name for the north wind, Boreas. From september to April, Iceland is a hotspot for this magnificent lightshow.</p>
                      <p>The Aurora Borelis, more commonly referred to as the Northern Lights is a natural phenomenon created when particles emitted by the sun interact with the atmosphere in the Earth's magnetic field. This releases energy, causing peculiar luminous green streaks across the skies.</p>

                      <p>When making a trip to Iceland, it is hard not to pay secial attention to the country's namesake-namely, its 4,500 square miles of glacier. Ice climbing on the glaciers is practice year round and takes place mainly on the Sólheimajökull and Svínafellsjökull glaciers in the south of Iceland, to which day trips are offered from Reykjavik(and Skaftafell).

                        Sólheimajökull glacier is an outlet from the mighty Mýrdalsjökull and is surrounded by some of Icelnad's most grand volcanoes and during summertime, a glacier lagoon forms in front of the glacier only adding to the charm of the location. This popular day tour is the perfect way to get in real contact with the true reason behind the name Ice-land!

                  <p>
                     The first time I filmed an aurora was from an icebreaker near Antarctica. Luckily, there are much more accessible places if you'd like to take in these light shows yourself. For the best seats to this celestial scene, consider anywhere with a magnetic latitude above 55&deg; and low light pollution. Find your magnetic latitude on NOAA and here.
                  </p>

                  <p>In the polar latitudes, auroras can appear on any dark night. Long winter nights are good but not necessarily the best time. Near equinoxes in March and September, the Earth's magnetic field lets more solar particles interact with the atmosphere, creating aurora seasons! I suggest autumunal equinox in September, when there are pleasant temperatures in polar latitudes. Find the dark hours of your location here, or by using a sky guide app. </p>
